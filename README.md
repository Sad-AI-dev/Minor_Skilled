THE GAME  

This game is a singleplayer action roguelike with the main goal of completing stage objectives to continue to the next stage. Killing enemies gives the player money which they can then use to open boxes scattered around the stage, these boxes drop one of over 30 items once opened. These items give the player a boost, these boosts range from a simple attack speed boost to applying status effects on hit to making enemies explode on death. After every stage the player will enter a "shop" where they get to buy items from a random selection. Enemy hit points, damage and spawnrate increases over time so in order to survive the player needs to be fast but also efficient in gathering items. The game will feature multiple stage objectives of which one will be randomly selected every stage.
